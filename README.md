## Lock your Executables


</div>

### Description

Password protect ANY executable file (.exe). This program allows you to put a password on a program so that everyone has to enter the correct password when it starts up. It will not let anyone run the program without the password. It is simple to use, and you don't even have to have the source code of the program you want to protect.
